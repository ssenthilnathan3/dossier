## System Architecture

The system is implemented as a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Core Services
1. **Webhook Handler** (Node.js) - Receives and validates Frappe webhooks
2. **Ingestion Service** (Python) - Processes documents and manages workflows
3. **Embedding Service** (Python) - Generates vector embeddings using BGE-small
4. **Query Service** (Python) - Handles semantic search and retrieval
5. **LLM Service** (Python) - Generates responses using Ollama
6. **API Gateway** (Python) - Authentication, rate limiting, and routing
7. **Frontend** (React) - Modern chat interface with real-time streaming

### Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL** - Configuration and metadata storage
- **Redis** - Message queuing and caching
- **Qdrant** - Vector database for semantic search
- **Ollama** - Local LLM inference engine

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Live Document Synchronization
- Real-time webhook processing with HMAC signature validation
- Automatic document ingestion with retry mechanisms
- Exponential backoff for failed processing
- Dead letter queue for manual review

### 2. Intelligent Text Chunking
- Recursive text splitting with semantic boundary detection
- Configurable chunk size and overlap
- Metadata preservation during chunking
- Graceful handling of empty or too-short content

### 3. Lightweight Vector Embeddings
- BGE-small model for efficient embedding generation
- Batch processing for optimal performance
- Metadata indexing in Qdrant
- Automatic reconnection and error recovery

### 4. Contextual Search and Retrieval
- Semantic similarity search with configurable parameters
- Top-k retrieval with filtering capabilities
- Sub-2-second response times for typical queries
- Source metadata preservation

### 5. Natural Language Q&A
- Integration with Ollama for local LLM inference
- Real-time response streaming
- Context injection from retrieved chunks
- Fallback responses for failures

### 6. Production-Ready Deployment
- Docker-first architecture with multi-stage builds
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Resource limits and optimization
- Graceful shutdown handling
